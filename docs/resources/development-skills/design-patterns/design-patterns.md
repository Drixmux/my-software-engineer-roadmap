# Design Patterns

Design patterns can be considered as general repeatable solutions to commonly occurring problems in software design. These solutions are categorized based on their purposes in the following three:

- [Creational Patterns](#creational-patterns)
- [Structural Patterns](#structural-patterns)
- [Behavioral Patterns](#behavioral-patterns)

## Creational patterns

Design patterns on this category help us abstracting the instantiation process. The following five patterns belong to this category:

- Singleton pattern
- Prototype pattern
- Factory Method pattern
- Builder pattern
- Abstract Factory pattern

## Structural patterns

This category focuses on how classes and objects can be composed to form relatively large structures. They generally use inheritance to compose interfaces or implementations. The following seven patterns fall into this category:

- Proxy pattern
- Flyweight pattern
- Composite pattern
- Bridge pattern
- Facade pattern
- Decorator pattern
- Adapter pattern

## Behavioral patterns

Here the concentration is on algorithms and the assignment of responsibilities among objects. You also need to focus on the communication between them and how the objects are interconnected. The following 11 patterns fall into this category:

- Observer pattern
- Strategy pattern
- Template Method pattern
- Command pattern
- Iterator pattern
- Memento pattern
- State pattern
- Mediator pattern
- Chain of Responsibility pattern
- Visitor pattern
- Interpreter pattern

The GoF made another classification based on scope, namely, whether the pattern primary focuses on the classes or its objects. Class patterns deal with classes and subclasses. They use inheritance mechanisms, which are static and fixed at compile time. Object patterns deal with objects that can change at run time. So, object patterns are dynamic.
