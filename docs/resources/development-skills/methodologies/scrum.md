# Scrum Methodology

Scrum is an agile development methodology used to develop software. It is designed to continuously deliver value to the customer so the team has quickly feedback about what's being developed.

# Roles used in Scrum

When it comes to Scrum, there is a team involved. The team will be focused on the same goal but with different tasks within the team.

A Scrum team is usually composed by the Scrum Master, the Product Owner and the development team composed between three and nine members. Each of these roles has different responsibilities and must be held accountable in different ways, both to each other and to the rest of the organization.

## Scrum master

The person who leads the team guiding them to comply with the processes of the methodology. Scrum Master should be the first person to help with any impediments that may arise related to the project. Scrum master should also keep the Scrum board updated.

## Product Owner (PO)

The person who is focus on the business part of the project. It means, the PO will be the bridge between the Scrum team and stakeholders/customers who use the software. PO shares the vision of the project to the team, and convert it into stories to be implemented by the team. All the stories are prioritized and added to the Product Backlog by the PO.

## Team

A group of professionals with the necessary technical knowledge to develop the project. They implement the committed work for the sprint. Usually the team is made up of people with knowledge of development and quality assurance.

# Events or Ceremonies

## Sprint

This is considered the basic unit of work for a Scrum team. The iteration usually lasts from 2 to 4 weeks.

## Sprint Planning

It happens at the beginning of each sprint. This ceremony is to define the goal of the sprint and also what's going to be done. The tasks/features planned for the sprint should be related to the sprint goal.

## Daily Scrum

It happens every day during the sprint. It is a short meeting where the team can talk about the progress of the tasks and how they are in relation to the fulfillment of the sprint goal. Three questions are answered individually:
- What did I do yesterday?
- What am I going to do today?
- What help do I need?

## Backlog Grooming

It doesn't have a frequency where it should happen, but it's good to have this session at least once in every  sprint.

Given in Scrum there's a product backlog that contains some features that the team may work on in the future, the team should give an opinion about the complexity and effort required to accomplish every feature. The Backlog Grooming ceremony is to review a group of items in the product backlog.

These are some of the activites during this meeting:
- Review items that are in product backlog.
- Estimate the reviewed items.
- Re-prioritize items.
- Split large items into smaller items.
- Remove items.

## Sprint Review or Demostration

It happens at the end of the sprint. The main goal is to review what has been completed and demonstrate it to the product owner and stakeholders. The team receives feedback so the team can re-prioritize some items in product backlog.

## Sprint Retrospective

It happens after sprint review and before sprint planning. The whole team reviews the completed goals of the finished sprint, and discuss about any good or bad stuff that happened during the sprint. The main goal of this ceremony would be to identify possible process improvements and see the way to implement them in the next Sprint. The team can define retro goals for these improvements.

# Scrum Artifacts

## Product Backlog

This is a list of items where each item describes a functionality of an specific part of the product. The items are prioritized according what is more or less important for the business.

## Sprint Backlog

This is a group of items taken from the product backlog. These items are selected by the team to be worked on during the sprint. This group of items is usually displayed on physical boards called scrum boards. It is also possible to handle the items in a virtual scrum board.

## Increment

The increment is the sum of everything that was worked during the sprint and that will be available to the end user.
