# My Software Engineer Roadmap
Once upon a time a friend of mine asked me the following question:

> What do you know?

He was talking about my software engineer career, and I would say it was easy to answer that question, but it was not a complete answer. I only mentioned all my current knowledge, I mean what technology I'm currently using on my project, but I didn't mention anything related to my previous projects.

Given that experience, I decided to spend sometime collecting all the knowledge I have and centralize it here.

My main programming language on this document will be JavaScript.
